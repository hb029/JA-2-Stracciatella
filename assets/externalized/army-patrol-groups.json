/**
 * This defines the Army Patrol Groups at the start of the game. There can only
 * be at most 50 Patrol Groups
 *
 * A point to sector A1 is ignored by the code, as the code assumes
 * nobody is using A1 in any of the patrol groups.
 *
 * Patrol points must not overlap with garrisoned sectors.
 *
 * Field definitions:
 *   - size:    number of soldiers in group
 *   - priority:    how important is this group to the Queen, when considering replacing troops
 *   - points:    sectors the group patrols. Must have at least two and at most four points
