/**
 * Mappings of Item IDs for pre-placed items on maps. This allows mods to
 * replace items with something else, or ignore totally. This does not affect
 * items created from other means.
 *
 * This is intended for compatibility and for maps that was originally built 
 * for different item sets (e.g. Wildfire maps).
 *
 * Items are identified by either item index (if given integer), or internal 
 * name (if given string). Items mapped to 0 ("Nothing") are removed from map 
 * placements.
 *
 * For example:
 *  [
 *     { "from": "KEVLAR_VEST", "to": "SPECTRA_VEST" },   // Replaces all Kevlar Vests on maps with Spectra Vests
 * 
 *     { "from": "HMX", "to": 0 }                         // HMX no longer placed on maps. Players can still create their own from ingredients
 *  ]
