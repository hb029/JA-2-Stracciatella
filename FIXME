BUGS
KillPreBattleInterface(): EnableDisAbleMapScreenOptionsButton(TRUE) maybe tries to enable non-existent buttons


animations:
animations in real time can be interrupted to avoid alarm while shooting, law hourglass must start before noise
V deactivate strafing and going backward because of gun display 
exception when npc stands at tileset, where the heli is spawned at refuling site - to insert central
pending action (move) is continued when changing assignment to heli with sector loaded
fast animations and wrong placement when leaving from heli into squad - sAniDelay
- fast animations increase with every entering, leaving of heli
- fast animations are load persistent
- with every load the speed decays
slow animations after battle
animation freeze if waiting for merc to let pass in water
V prone stance impossible in some maps for certain orientations

editor:
- howard does not confess - ConverseFull?
V g41 in grumm with 5.45 ammo, m-14 in alma with 5.56 ammo
- throwing knifes fly on roof-top level at drassen mine

ai:
interrupt at standing up for throwing and LAW or forbid action not standing
ai must figure in crouch/duck on roofs and open/close behind doors
AI uses mortar under roof
pointless battle after annoying joey and going back to surface
V ai tries to reach panic buttons even if attacking a sector
panic buttons do not make sense
conrad and slay desert (hostile + flee) if superior

engine:
"
If you right click an item when leaving buy/sell screen (while merchant speaks his "goodbye" phrase), the shopkeeper transaction and done buttons will stay on screen (tactial/strategical) forever until you talk to another shopkeeper.

To reproduce - open buy/sell screen, press done, immediately right click any item in your inventory, wait until speech is finished or click the box with shopkeeper text, done.bank account menu in tactics screen not displayed properly
"
clearing mines with full hands moves it to another mercs inventory
V stealing takes too many AP
V gas effect on roof-top level transfers to the basic level
exception when changing sector in tactical - merc placement error - no ctd
error while loading map, press esc randomly, not reproducible, civ/militia placement?
endless hourglass at realtime switch after isolated enemy without visual contact throws a gas-grenade in the last turn 
leaving a battle sector with truck breaks the squad table (truck remains bound to wrong squad number) - OKForSectorExit - bugreports100930/2 - forbid?
no bleeding when changing sector in tactical screen
shopkeeper faces do not talk properly while dragging an item - vanilla
X tony out of office at first opening - hans does never open the shop
sal says the wrong lines when forgetting about shipments instead of stealing

reproduction pending:
X multiple air-raids without point
reinforcement underground for air raid on top placed wrong
merc gives a sniper rifle to a dual pistol merc with full inventory - burst stays
V persistent muzzle flash after fighting in towns - which case?!
V- TurnOffTeamsMuzzleFlashes( gbPlayerNum );
shipment never arrives and is not displayed when selected (day 13, 4 items)
V skyrider npc placed odd in airport sector
X enemy caught at off-map tile when fleeing
ctd at bloodcat spawn in enemy controlled sector
meduna remote used twice - ctd
AI lock when Bloodcat steps on mine
AI lock in enemy turn (toss grenade move)

WORKLIST
V second robot does not appear - npc-script problem
X robot only after creature quest
X every corpse only yields one glass of blood esp. the queen
V every corpse only yields blood for two minutes
V interrupt at every attack - boxing, fire-fight
X stack mergibles (tnt) and merge only in hand 1
V giHospitalRefund is not a multiple of 10
V rubber band - attach two large magazines
V bonus on far enemies interruption
V impact reduction by distance
X BulletHitMerc warning


IDEALIST
pick-up button instead of drag drop
optimization of moved merc by AI
report cannot drop here, if the tile to drop has too many items (ctd)
path ai considering lower energy cost for equal length paths
consistent energy cost in rt and tb

ai uses cth for movement
ai remembers last guns calibre fired upon it
ai guesses the basic cth of each merc by its hit statistic

X enemy attack groups hidden (unhide groups with civ quotes)
X items are stolen everywhere exponential with the stack height
X moving items is a game of chance
X use what you find
X the inventory consists of a list of big slots
X the limit remains but the stacks are resolved
X in case is it with hit processing every other move?
V no interrupt for fleeing enemies at the edge of the map
V interrupt chance for every attack
V robot2 has robot1's weapon
V robot1 has public stats when dead
V robot2 does not show up, when sector is loaded
X tony does not show up, when absent initially
tony does not change appearence when sector is loaded

V iterrupt under fire
X enemy moves soldiers with minimal number of sightings first


V doctors do not realize sufficient supplies returned after stealing
V- stacks are not handled properly, a stack counts as one item
X interrupt after pass - ai never passes, so player would benefit

V kingpin civ group does not exchange places -> no exploits
V san mona movement cost
X grumm movement cost

V- pc wins at boxer side of ring -> darren does not give money
V- pc enters at boxer side of ring -> match does not end
V- wrong civilians were boxing
