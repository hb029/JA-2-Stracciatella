**                                  IMPORTANT TRANSLATION NOTES                                     **
******************************************************************************************************

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Always be aware that foreign strings should be of equal or shorter length than the English equivalent.
	I know that this is difficult to do on many occasions due to the nature of foreign languages when
	compared to English.  By doing so, this will greatly reduce the amount of work on both sides.  In
	most cases (but not all), JA2 interfaces were designed with just enough space to fit the English word.
	The general rule is if the string is very short (less than 10 characters), then it's short because of
	interface limitations.  On the other hand, full sentences commonly have little limitations for length.
	Strings in between are a little dicey.
- Never translate a string to appear on multiple lines.  All strings L"This is a really long string...",
	must fit on a single line no matter how long the string is.  All strings start with L" and end with ",
- Never remove any extra spaces in strings.  In addition, all strings containing multiple sentences only
	have one space after a period, which is different than standard typing convention.  Never modify sections
	of strings contain combinations of % characters.  These are special format characters and are always
	used in conjunction with other characters.  For example, %s means string, and is commonly used for names,
	locations, items, etc.  %d is used for numbers.  %c%d is a character and a number (such as A9).
	%% is how a single % character is built.  There are countless types, but strings containing these
	special characters are usually commented to explain what they mean.  If it isn't commented, then
	if you can't figure out the context, then feel free to ask SirTech.
- Comments are always started with // Anything following these two characters on the same line are
	considered to be comments.  Do not translate comments.  Comments are always applied to the following
	string(s) on the next line(s), unless the comment is on the same line as a string.
- All new comments made by SirTech will use "//@@@ comment" (without the quotes) notation.  By searching
	for @@@ everytime you recieve a new version, it will simplify your task and identify special instructions.
  Commonly, these types of comments will be used to ask you to abbreviate a string.  Please leave the
	comments intact, and SirTech will remove them once the translation for that particular area is resolved.
- If you have a problem or question with translating certain strings, please use "//!!! comment"
	(without the quotes).  The syntax is important, and should be identical to the comments used with @@@
	symbols.  SirTech will search for !!! to look for your problems and questions.  This is a more
	efficient method than detailing questions in email, so try to do this whenever possible.



FAST HELP TEXT -- Explains how the syntax of fast help text works.
**************

1) BOLDED LETTERS
	The popup help text system supports special characters to specify the hot key(s) for a button.
	Anytime you see a '|' symbol within the help text string, that means the following key is assigned
	to activate the action which is usually a button.

	EX:  L"|Map Screen"

	This means the 'M' is the hotkey.  In the game, when somebody hits the 'M' key, it activates that
	button.  When translating the text to another language, it is best to attempt to choose a word that
	uses 'M'.  If you can't always find a match, then the best thing to do is append the 'M' at the end
	of the string in this format:

	EX:  L"Ecran De Carte (|M)"  (this is the French translation)

	Other examples are used multiple times, like the Esc key  or "|E|s|c" or Space -> (|S|p|a|c|e)

2) NEWLINE
  Any place you see a \n within the string, you are looking at another string that is part of the fast help
	text system.  \n notation doesn't need to be precisely placed within that string, but whereever you wish
	to start a new line.

	EX:  L"Clears all the mercs' positions,\nand allows you to re-enter them manually."

	Would appear as:

				Clears all the mercs' positions,
				and allows you to re-enter them manually.

	NOTE:  It is important that you don't pad the characters adjacent to the \n with spaces.  If we did this
	       in the above example, we would see

	WRONG WAY -- spaces before and after the \n
	EX:  L"Clears all the mercs' positions, \n and allows you to re-enter them manually."

	Would appear as: (the second line is moved in a character)

				Clears all the mercs' positions,
 				 and allows you to re-enter them manually.


@@@ NOTATION
************

	Throughout the text files, you'll find an assortment of comments.  Comments are used to describe the
	text to make translation easier, but comments don't need to be translated.  A good thing is to search for
	"@@@" after receiving new version of the text file, and address the special notes in this manner.

!!! NOTATION
************

	As described above, the "!!!" notation should be used by you to ask questions and address problems as
	SirTech uses the "@@@" notation.
