// **                                  IMPORTANT TRANSLATION NOTES                                     **
// ******************************************************************************************************
//
// GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
// - Always be aware that foreign strings should be of equal or shorter length than the English equivalent.
//   I know that this is difficult to do on many occasions due to the nature of foreign languages when
//   compared to English.  By doing so, this will greatly reduce the amount of work on both sides.  In
//   most cases (but not all), JA2 interfaces were designed with just enough space to fit the English word.
//   The general rule is if the string is very short (less than 10 characters), then it's short because of
//   interface limitations.  On the other hand, full sentences commonly have little limitations for length.
//   Strings in between are a little dicey.
// - Never translate a string to appear on multiple lines.  All strings "This is a really long string...",
//   must fit on a single line no matter how long the string is.  All strings start with " and end with ",
// - Never remove any extra spaces in strings.  In addition, all strings containing multiple sentences only
//   have one space after a period, which is different than standard typing convention.  Never modify sections
//   of strings contain combinations of % characters.  These are special format characters and are always
//   used in conjunction with other characters.  For example, %s means string, and is commonly used for names,
//   locations, items, etc.  %d is used for numbers.  %c%d is a character and a number (such as A9).
//   %% is how a single % character is built.  There are countless types, but strings containing these
//   special characters are usually commented to explain what they mean.  If it isn't commented, then
//   if you can't figure out the context, then feel free to ask SirTech.
// - Comments are always started with // Anything following these two characters on the same line are
//   considered to be comments.  Do not translate comments.  Comments are always applied to the following
//   string(s) on the next line(s), unless the comment is on the same line as a string.
// - All new comments made by SirTech will use "//@@@ comment" (without the quotes) notation.  By searching
//   for @@@ everytime you recieve a new version, it will simplify your task and identify special instructions.
//   Commonly, these types of comments will be used to ask you to abbreviate a string.  Please leave the
//   comments intact, and SirTech will remove them once the translation for that particular area is resolved.
// - If you have a problem or question with translating certain strings, please use "//!!! comment"
//   (without the quotes).  The syntax is important, and should be identical to the comments used with @@@
//   symbols.  SirTech will search for !!! to look for your problems and questions.  This is a more
//   efficient method than detailing questions in email, so try to do this whenever possible.
//
//
//
// FAST HELP TEXT -- Explains how the syntax of fast help text works.
// **************
//
// 1) BOLDED LETTERS
//   The popup help text system supports special characters to specify the hot key(s) for a button.
//   Anytime you see a '|' symbol within the help text string, that means the following key is assigned
//   to activate the action which is usually a button.
//
//   EX:  "|Map Screen"
//
//   This means the 'M' is the hotkey.  In the game, when somebody hits the 'M' key, it activates that
//   button.  When translating the text to another language, it is best to attempt to choose a word that
//   uses 'M'.  If you can't always find a match, then the best thing to do is append the 'M' at the end
//   of the string in this format:
//
//   EX:  "Ecran De Carte (|M)"  (this is the French translation)
//
//   Other examples are used multiple times, like the Esc key  or "|E|s|c" or Space -> (|S|p|a|c|e)
//
// 2) NEWLINE
//   Any place you see a \n within the string, you are looking at another string that is part of the fast help
//   text system.  \n notation doesn't need to be precisely placed within that string, but whereever you wish
//   to start a new line.
//
//   EX:  "Clears all the mercs' positions,\nand allows you to re-enter them manually."
//
//   Would appear as:
//
//     Clears all the mercs' positions,
//     and allows you to re-enter them manually.
//
//   NOTE:  It is important that you don't pad the characters adjacent to the \n with spaces.  If we did this
//     in the above example, we would see
//
//   WRONG WAY -- spaces before and after the \n
//   EX:  "Clears all the mercs' positions, \n and allows you to re-enter them manually."
//
//   Would appear as: (the second line is moved in a character)
//
//     Clears all the mercs' positions,
//     and allows you to re-enter them manually.
//
//
// @@@ NOTATION
// ************
//
//   Throughout the text files, you'll find an assortment of comments.  Comments are used to describe the
//   text to make translation easier, but comments don't need to be translated.  A good thing is to search for
//   "@@@" after receiving new version of the text file, and address the special notes in this manner.
//
// !!! NOTATION
// ************
//
//   As described above, the "!!!" notation should be used by you to ask questions and address problems as
//   SirTech uses the "@@@" notation.
